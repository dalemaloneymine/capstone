<header><h1>How Do I Become A Member?</h1>
<p>Becoming a user of the website is extremely easy, just fill out the form and you will be able to view membership lists, vehicle lists,
and upcoming events.  To become a member of the club you can just leave a message here, or contact a member, then check to see when the
next meeting is going to happen.  Then just come to the meeting and tell us a little about yourselves.  By the next meeting we will vote
and then you will be able to be a club member.  

Dues are $25 the first year and then just $10 a year thereafter.  It is not a requirement that you have an vehicle you can show, you just
need a love of vehicles and car culture.  As a member you can help at our show in a number of ways.  We have committees that meet and
take charge of the different functions of the show.  Committees range from, parking, registration, check-in, advertising, food, and many
others.  We like to think of ourselves as a big family and we conduct ourselves that way.  We like to participate in area shows and have
on multiple occassions been asked to even help judge shows.  

In an effort to bring the vehicle hobby to more people, we offer a scholarship each year to a deserving student.  This is to help them
with college expenses, and goes directly to the financial office of the school to be applied to the bill.  We proudly donate to 
area charities and to families that are in need.  

Our meetings are held every second Thursday of the month from March to December.  We meet in the evening after work and usually are
at a local resturant.  There we eat, laugh and conduct the business we need to do.  Many show up early to get some more visiting done.
We are just like a family that way.  We listen to everyone and give everyone a say in what happens, then we vote to see what direction
we are going to go.
